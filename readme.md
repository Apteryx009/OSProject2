OS Project 2

This project is for CS4328: Operating Systems at TXST
This simulates a greasy card game.

Main Work:
    Engineered a multi-threaded card game in C with synchronized turn management and resource access using mutexes and condition variables.
    Implemented gameplay mechanics including card shuffling, drawing, and dynamic refill logic.
    Integrated game state logging and randomness elements for enhanced gameplay experience and debugging.


To get up and running:
Clone the project files. 

Please use format: int{seed} int{num_of_players} int{chips_in_each_bag}
seeding should also work with floats as well. 

run: 
gcc main.c -o main
./main 
OR 
./main 1 6 30



Design:
1. Application Overview

    Type: Multi-threaded card game simulation in C.
    Libraries: POSIX Threads (pthreads), Standard C Library.

2. Key Components

    Card Structure: Represents playing cards with suit, value, and numericValue.
    Deck Management: Functions to initialize, shuffle, and manage a card deck.
    Player Threads: Separate threads simulate individual player actions.
    Synchronization: Mutexes (pthread_mutex_t) and a condition variable (pthread_cond_t) for thread-safe operations and turn management.
    Game State Variables: Global variables to track game status, including numPlayers, chipsInBag, and currentPlayer.
    Logging System: logFile for recording game events and states.

3. Game Flow

    Initialization: Set up the game environment, including deck and threads.
    Gameplay Loop: Players draw cards, manage chips, and take turns in a synchronized manner, with game state updates logged.
    Resource Management: Ensures proper cleanup of resources post-gameplay (memory, mutexes, file handling).


Implementation:
    Thread Management: My program utilizes POSIX threads (pthreads) to simulate multiple players. Each player is represented by a separate thread, created and managed using pthread_create and pthread_join. Thread synchronization is crucial to handle shared resources and turn management.

    Synchronization Mechanisms: Mutexes (chipsBagMutex, cardDeckMutex, greasyCardMutex) and a condition variable (cond) are used to synchronize access to shared resources like the card deck and chips bag. The mutex locks prevent concurrent access to shared resources, ensuring thread safety, while the condition variable controls the turn order of players.

    Deck Initialization and Management: The deck of cards is initialized in the initializeDeck function, assigning suits and values to each card. The deck is shuffled using the Fisher-Yates algorithm in shuffleDeck. A special "greasy card" is drawn from the deck in drawGreasyCard, which plays a unique role in the game mechanics.

    Gameplay and Logic: The routine function, which each player thread executes, encapsulates the core game logic. It includes player actions like waiting for their turn (using pthread_cond_wait), drawing cards, comparing them with the greasy card, and handling chips. The function also controls the game's flow, updating the current player and the round count.

    Resource Management and Logging: The program demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for player numbers and proper cleanup at the end of the game, including freeing memory and destroying mutexes. It also features a logging system, where game events and states are logged to a file (logFile), aiding in debugging and tracking the game's progress.

    Game Termination Conditions: The game has built-in logic to handle termination conditions, such as running out of cards. When such a condition is met, the program exits gracefully after performing necessary cleanup operations.
